      <p>
        Anti-Black racism is sustained by systems of discrimination that are
        pervasive accross our society, and academic spaces are no exception.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inspired by the recent
        <a href="https://www.shutdownstem.com/" target="_blank">
          #ShutDownSTEM</a>
        movement and in response to the continued violence against Black people
        in the United States, #ShutdownPL @ POPL &rsquo;22 will offer a safe
        space to collaborate and take action against racism and systems of
        oppression in the programming languages community.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our goal is to enact positive change via concrete planning and action,
        and we&rsquo;re very excited to work with you toward that end.
      </p>
