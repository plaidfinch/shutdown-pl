      <p>
        Anti-Black racism is sustained by systems of discrimination that are
        pervasive accross our society, and academic spaces are no exception.
        Inspired by the recent
        <a href="https://www.shutdownstem.com/" target="_blank">
          #ShutDownSTEM</a>
        movement and in response to the continued violence against Black people
        in the United States, #ShutdownPL aims to offer a safe space in which
        to collaborate and take action against racism and systems of oppression
        in the programming languages community and beyond.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Important note</b>: As of now, none of the organizers of #ShutdownPL
        are Black. We do not want to demand labor of Black voices; however, the
        last thing we want is an organization of non-Black researchers speaking
        for and taking actions on the behalf of Black researchers without their
        input. Accordingly, we will ensure all our commitments to act begin from
        a place of listening to the Black community within and beyond
        programming languages research.
